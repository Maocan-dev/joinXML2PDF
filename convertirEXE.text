pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed your_script_name.py
# Replace 'your_script_name.py' with the name of your Python script
# This command will create a single executable file without a console window
Explanation:

--noconfirm: Skip overwrite prompts.

--onefile: Bundle everything into a single .exe.

--windowed: Prevents a console window from opening (perfect for GUI apps).

Locate your .exe: After running, you'll find the .exe in the dist/ directory.
